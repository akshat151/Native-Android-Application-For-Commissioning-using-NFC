Collaborated with a team of 5 members to develop Lenze Smart Motor app, a Native Android Mobile Application used to commission Lenze Smart Motor via NFC.

This app allows the parameterization of the Lenze Smart Motor with an NFC-enabled smartphone or tablet.

The Lenze Smart Motor app reduces the number of different drive versions by up to 70%. Contactor and starter do not feature, fixed speeds can be set at will and there are numerous integrated functions for materials handling applications.

The Application is available on the Android PlayStore using the below link.
